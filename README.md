# Anti-Rape Safety Device 🚨

🔒 About the Project
This Anti-Rape Safety Device is a patented wearable security solution designed to protect individuals in emergencies. It is equipped with pressure sensors, AI-based object detection, real-time location tracking, and an emergency alert system. The device ensures immediate response by notifying emergency contacts, the nearest police station, and hospitals when triggered.

⚙️ Features

  ✔ Pressure Sensor Alert – Detects push or pull forces and automatically sends alerts.
 
  ✔ Backup Push Button – Allows manual activation if the sensor fails.
 
  ✔ AI Object Detection – Uses YOLO model to detect and capture images of harmful objects (e.g., weapons).
 
  ✔ ESP32 Location Tracking – Determines the user’s live location and finds the nearest police station & hospital.
 
  ✔ Real-time Emergency Alert – Sends messages with live location to five emergency contacts.
 
  ✔ Incident Recording – Includes a camera & microphone to capture evidence.

🛠️ Technologies Used

  -> Python – Machine learning & AI-based object detection (YOLO).

  -> Arduino – Hardware integration and sensor control.

  -> ESP32 (IoT) – Location tracking & real-time emergency messaging.

  -> Data Analysis – Optimizing detection accuracy and emergency response.

📜 How It Works

  1️⃣ The pressure sensor detects an unwanted push or pull and triggers an alert.

  2️⃣ The ESP32 module calculates the nearest police station & hospital using GPS data.

  3️⃣ An emergency alert with live location is sent to 5 contacts and authorities.

  4️⃣ The YOLO AI model detects harmful objects and captures images for evidence.

  5️⃣ The camera and microphone start recording to document the incident.
